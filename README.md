Real-Time Location Tracking App

This project is a web-based real-time location tracking application. It utilizes Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and Leaflet.js to provide a seamless and interactive map experience for tracking the geographical locations of connected clients in real-time.

Features
Real-Time Location Updates: Clients can share their geographical location with the server, which then broadcasts the location to all connected clients.
Interactive Map: The application displays an interactive map using Leaflet.js, allowing users to visualize real-time location updates.
WebSocket Communication: Utilizes Socket.io to enable real-time bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
Technologies Used
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
Socket.io: A library for real-time web applications, enabling real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
Leaflet.js: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates): A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
